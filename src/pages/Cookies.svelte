				<p>Qualcomm Incorporated and its subsidiaries (collectively “we”, “us” and “our”) use cookies and a variety of similar technologies on its websites. In addition to cookies, such technologies include Local Shared Objects (i.e., Flash Cookies) and web beacons (i.e., single pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, or web bugs). We refer to these technologies collectively as “cookies”. This Cookie Policy explains the use of cookies when you visit any of our websites that provide a link to this Cookie Policy. See “Your Choices” below to manage cookies.</p>
				<h3>What is a Cookie?</h3>
				<p>A cookie is a small data file that may be stored on the hard drive of your computer or device in your browser’s file directory when you access our website. When you visit one of our websites, cookies may be set by us (first party cookies) or by other companies (third party cookies) such as cookies from Google Analytics, Typekit, Disqus, and Addthis. When you return to one of our websites, or when you access other web pages within one of our websites, your web browser will send the information stored in the cookie to us or to the third party that set the cookie. For more information explaining cookies, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
				<h3>How are Cookies used?</h3>
				<p>Cookies are used on our websites for a variety of purposes:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Basic Functions.</strong> Some of our websites use cookies that are strictly necessary in order to provide a function of the website such as to keep you logged-in where registration is required or to provide a shopping cart. These cookies may be set by us, or by third parties, such as a “Like” button by Facebook or a “Tweet” button by Twitter.</li>
					<li><strong>Site Improvement.</strong> Some of our websites use cookies to better understand how visitors are using our websites to improve the information and functionality of our websites. These cookies help us learn, for example, if some webpages are not being frequently visited or if visitors are having difficulties navigating our websites. These cookies may be set by us, or by third-party companies such as Google or NetInsight.</li>
					<li><strong>Personalization.</strong> Some of our websites use cookies to personalize the content that is displayed on our site, or to remember you when you return to our site. For example, we may use a blog tool Disqus.</li>
					<li><strong>Advertising.</strong> Third party advertising companies may have our permission to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet or to display ads for other companies on our site. These third party advertising companies use cookies to measure and improve the effectiveness of their advertising. To do so, these companies may use generic information about your visits to our sites and other websites for online preference marketing purposes, in order to provide ads about goods and services of specific interest to you.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>How Long are Cookies Stored?</h3>
				<p>We set cookies to expire after they have fulfilled their purpose. Our websites use cookies that expire when you close your browser (i.e., session cookies) or that expire after a set period of time (i.e., so-called “persistent cookies”). Cookies that are stored by third parties will have their expiration period determined by the third party, not us.</p>
